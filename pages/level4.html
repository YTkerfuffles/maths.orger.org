  <h1>Level 4 – GCSE and A level maths full justification</h1>
  <p>This is an A level maths proof companion consisting of documents and videos where intuition or proofs are provided for all results in A level maths used as black boxes, some of which you may not have even realized required justification—when that happens, I explain why justification is needed. The proofs for statistics are included with the further maths proof companions in level 6 as those tend to be more complicated.</p>
  <p>You would benefit from this if one of the following (or equivalent for a non‑British system) describes you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A level maths students seeking to go beyond the curriculum</li>
    <li>A level further maths students</li>
    <li>A level maths students interested in better understanding the material</li>
    <li>A level maths students interested to understand the “why” for results or formulas or methods that are not typically properly justified in A level textbooks or their exercises but still used in GCSEs or A level pure maths</li>
    <li>Students aiming for an A or an A* in A level maths</li>
    <li>Anyone considering pursuing maths at university</li>
    <li>Undergraduate maths students</li>
    <li>Maths teachers or prospective maths teachers (A level teachers in particular)</li>
  </ul>
