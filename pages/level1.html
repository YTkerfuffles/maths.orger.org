  <h1>Level 1 – Arithmetic and algebra basics</h1>
  <p>This is designed for anyone who is bad at maths, struggles with maths or not confident with their maths. I have made an effort to address various pitfalls and struggles that I have seen when talking to struggling mathematicians in this video. If you are at least as good at maths as being able to get a grade A or a confident/strong B on maths GCSE papers or equivalent, you probably don’t need this.</p>
