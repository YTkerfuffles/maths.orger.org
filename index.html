      <h1>Welcome to maths.orger.org!</h1>
      <p>I was originally making notes to keep my own maths knowledge and proof dependencies organized but now it seems to actually be a useful supplementary material that I wish I had when I was an A level student.</p>
      <p>Be mindful that while I have gone through great lengths, and I think done a good job, to make these as accessible as possible, some of the proofs are very quick while others are long and technical and may require perseverance to follow, but don’t give up! This is the tradeoff to do this “Used at that level ⇒ proved at that level, no higher background assumed” philosophy that I hold. For example, the central limit theorem is used at A level but takes 11 pages of algebra to prove from previous ideas at an A level background.</p>
      <p>Note that some proofs appeal to intuition. I try to keep things rigorous most of the time, but when it’s much easier to appeal to intuition, I do so. For example, I don’t think proof is needed to convince you that a hill with no jumps that goes from an altitude of 0 meters to 2 meters has a point on it at an altitude of 1 meter.</p>
      <p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:ufkerfuffle@gmail.com">ufkerfuffle@gmail.com</a> to suggest better proofs or explanations, correct errors, or just to chat! If an error affects a complicated proof, please suggest an alternative self‑contained route.</p>
